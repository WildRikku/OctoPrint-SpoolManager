Thank you for creating a pull request. Please follow the following rules:

* Every pull request should be linked to an issue. This allows it to be included in the release notes automatically. This saves time so I can work on bug fixes and new features. Linking is easy: Write # followed by the issue number in this description.
* If there is no issue yet, please [create one](https://github.com/WildRikku/OctoPrint-SpoolManager/issues/new/choose).
* If the issue describes everything you did in the pull request, it is not necessary to repeat it here.
* Your commit messages should describe the commits properly. Otherwise, it is very hard to understand your code. Pull requests or commits that are hard to understand might be rejected. This is for safety reasons.
* The use of code generated by large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT or GitHub Copilot is not allowed. The error rate of code generated by these tools is too high.
